## Research Experience

- **North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA** \
  _**Graduate Research Assistant** (Aug 2023 - Present)_

  - Realized 10% improvement per iteration in compressed LLM inference by identifying bottlenecks in PyTorch components
  - Introduced novel tensor contraction techniques into an existing tensorized transformer model connecting PyTorch to high performance CUDA/C++ libraries. Studied implications/overhead of multi-language library use.
  - Created pipelines to benchmark intermediate layer operations from PyTorch such as Transformer, Dense on NVIDIA GPUs

- **Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India** \
  _**Research Intern** (Jun 2020 - Oct 2021)_

  - Trained complex-valued regression models for loudspeaker source localization performing 5 times faster than conventional numerical methods while preserving accuracy. Co-authored a [publication](https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0017115) in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.
  - Co-authored a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/1475472X221136884) to recognize, localize and reconstruct pressure signals to model it on an adjacent surface

- **Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Chennai, India** \
  _**Research Intern** (Apr 22 - Aug 22, Apr 21 - Aug 21)_
  - Used gradient boosting and graph neural networks to predict ambulance response times based on position in Chennai city
  - Project done in collaboration with 108 ambulance service of Chennai (State Govt of Tamil Nadu)
  - Worked on predicting student dropouts from NPTEL (MOOC) courses focusing on explainability. Insights gained were used by NPTEL to understand and combat various issues leading to student dropouts

## Work Experience

- **Poshmark Chennai, India** \
  _**Software Engineer - 1** (Aug 2022 - Jul 2023)_

  - Developed key infrastructure for the [Poshmark iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poshmark-buy-sell-fashion/id470412147) such as screen pagination algorithms from scratch in the SwiftUI Combine based publisher-subscriber design paradigm
  - Migrated multiple legacy objective C components to the SwiftUI MVVM design pattern, resulting in a 60% reduction in code complexity and 10% improvement in screen load times. Oversaw slow-roll out of new components through A/B testing

- **Kaleris (formerly Navis), Chennai, India**\
  _**Associate Software Engineer - Intern** (Jan 2022 - Jul 2022)_

  - Resolved mission critical bugs in the [Navis N4 Terminal Operating System](https://kaleris.com/solutions/terminal-operating-system/), increasing system stability and code coverage
  - Worked on an adjacent AI-aided solution to enable smart docking of ships saving∼15 minutes of manual calculation

- **Renault Nissan Technology and Business Centre, Chennai, India**\
  _**Software Development Intern** (Aug 2021 - Oct 2021)_
  - Designed and developed a scalable cloud-based pipeline to enable car dealerships to remotely communicate key data points to analysts. Pushed the MVP into production with minimal errors
  - Application reduces delay in creating analytical reports & minimizes manual entry errors through multiple validation checks bringing down weekly engineering efforts of data transfer and validation from∼3 hours to a few minutes

## Projects

- **Efficient Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation** \
  Designed a model splitting technique speeding up
  model uncertainty estimation by upto 33x. Devised technique can be applied to pre-existing models as well. (Link). Project guided by [Prof. Dongkuan Xu](https://dongkuanx27.github.io/) at NC State. [(Link)](https://github.com/srina1h/EfficientMCDropout/blob/main/Efficent_MC_Dropout.pdf)

- **Synthetic cough generation using diffusion models** \
  Used a diffusion model to generate synthetic data for the
  small COUGHVID dataset for better Covid-19 cough detection. Improved efficiency using latent diffusion to achieve similar performance with lower training time. [(Link)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WsV3QAVr_49dOCVxz72BnP2ib0yyAqlmq3pRdoYtIVA/edit?usp=sharing)

- **LLVM tool for C code optimization** \
  Created a 2 part tool to parse LLVM IR and based on variable
  reuse, identify the most influential variables on runtime performance and judge libraries adding most overhead. [(Link)](https://github.com/CSC512-Course-Project/part-3-sub)

- **Retinal OCT - Disease Classification** \
  Retinal disease identification using Optical Coherence Tomography images.
  Comparison of VGG-19 and lightweight MobileNet v2 based transfer learning models. Highlights potential of
  lightweight models in complex tasks. [(Link)](https://github.com/srina1h/RetinalOCT/blob/main/retinal%20OCT%20-%20Project%20report.pdf)
