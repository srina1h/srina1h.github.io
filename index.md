## About Me

I am a Master's student at [North Carolina State University Raleigh](https://ncsu.edu), USA. I am part of the TensorWorld group advised by [Dr. Jiajia Li](https://fruitfly1026.github.io/). We are working towards accelerating compressed/tensorized transformers. I am working on effective tensor contraction techniques and accelerating GEMM algorithms for this purpose.

I was previously a Software Engineer at Poshmark working on their iOS app. At Poshmark I led efforts to port several of their legacy MVC Objective-C code to the Swift/SwiftUI MVVM paradigm. We redesigned several screens from scratch including creating an efficient pagination algorithm for some screens with heavy scroll cases.

During my undergrad, I worked in the [Thermodynamics and Combustion Engineering Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/site/jetflowacoustics/welcome-to-prof-srinivasans-homepage/research-areas-and-facilities?authuser=0) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://iitm.ac.in). I worked on using Machine Learning to localize and reconstruct acoustic signals. I have also worked at the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI to predict student dropouts from MOOCs and on a project to predict ambulance timings for the Govt. of Tamil Nadu 108 ambulance service. I have also had 2 SWE internships at Navis and Renault.

Feel free to shoot me an email to discuss any opportunities/for research collaboration!
